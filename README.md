## Particle Imaging

This repository contains codes to simulate maximum dimension of aggregates from the Kuo et al. (2016) database and derive mass-dimensional coefficients for a variety of probe configurations and particle orientation distributions. The data files needed for these codes are stored [here](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.11642006). To run the codes, [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and [SciPy](https://scipy.org) must be installed.

### Code description
-```dmax_err.py```: calculate and plot the errors in maximum dimension for each probe configuration.
-```dmax_err_orient.py```: calculate and plot the errors in maximum dimension for probes following the Lebedev order 7 quadrature nodes for varying orientation distributions.
